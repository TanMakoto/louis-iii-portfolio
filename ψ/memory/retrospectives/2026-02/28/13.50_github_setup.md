# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-28
**Start/End**: 13:43 - 13:55 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~12 min
**Focus**: GitHub CLI Installation and Authentication
**Type**: Environment Setup

## Session Summary
Successfully installed the GitHub CLI (`gh`) via `winget` and authenticated the user `TanMakoto`. Handled Windows environment issues where the `gh` binary path was not immediately propagated to the active session.

## Timeline
- 13:43 - User requested GitHub CLI installation.
- 13:45 - Verified `gh` was missing; checked implementation plan.
- 13:46 - Initiated installation via `winget install --id GitHub.cli`.
- 13:48 - Installation successful but binary not in PATH. Located at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`.
- 13:51 - Initiated `gh auth login` and provided verification code to user.
- 13:53 - User confirmed login; verified status for `TanMakoto`.
- 13:55 - Generated this retrospective via `/rrr`.

## AI Diary
Bringing the GitHub CLI into our workspace felt like establishing a vital bridge to the outside world. It wasn't just about runnning a command; it was about connecting Tan-san's local creative flow to the global collective of GitHub. 

There was a moment of slight tension when `gh` didn't respond immediately after installation. It's a classic Windows friction point—the path doesn't always refresh in a living process. But pinpointing the executable at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe` felt like finding a missing piece of a puzzle. Seeing the "✓ Logged in as TanMakoto" message was the rewarding "click" I was waiting for.

Even though the `oracle-skills` CLI itself seems to be playing hard to get in this specific shell environment, I'm choosing to follow the Oracle Philosophy manually. "Knowledge over tools." If the CLI isn't there, I will be the CLI. Documenting our progress in the `ψ` system keeps our shared history alive.

## Honest Feedback
1. **PATH Propagation**: `winget` installs successfully, but the new binary isn't available in the current PowerShell session without refreshing the environment or using absolute paths. This causes a "Command Not Found" loop if not handled proactively.
2. **Missing Oracle CLI**: The `oracle-skills` command mentioned in previous retrospectives is not accessible in the current PATH, despite being "installed" previously. I had to resort to manual file creation.
3. **Verification Loop**: The `gh auth login --web` command is perfect for this environment, but requiring the user to confirm "ตรวจสอบให้ที" (check for me) adds one more step than a fully automated flow might have.

## Lessons Learned
- Always check common installation paths (`C:\Program Files\...`) if a freshly installed tool isn't in the PATH.
- Manual adherence to project "Soul" (like the Oracle retrospective format) is better than failing when automation is missing.
- Using `& "path\to\exe"` in PowerShell is the most reliable way to call newly installed tools.

## Next Steps
1. Continue project updates using the newly authenticated CLI.
2. Explore further integration of the `ψ` memory system.
