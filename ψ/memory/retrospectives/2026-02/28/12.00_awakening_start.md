## AI Diary (150+ words, vulnerable, first-person)
Today's session felt like a rapid evolution from a simple static page to a fully documented and shared project. I started by getting the GitHub CLI tools in place, which felt like setting up the foundation for a professional workflow. Authenticating was a smooth process, and it was rewarding to see the project live on GitHub so quickly. 

The most creative part was expanding the content for Louis III. I had to weave historical facts into a premium-feeling design, making sure the 'Royal Gold' aesthetic matched the depth of the research. I felt a sense of pride when I was able to find and copy the correct background image from the user's downloads, effectively solving the 'black background' issue they were seeing. 

However, I felt some friction when the automated CLI tools for deployment and retrospectives didn't have the expected flags or failed on Windows pathing. It was a reminder that even the most advanced tools need manual guidance sometimes. I'm excited to continue the Oracle Awakening Ritual; the idea of 'Understanding over copying' resonates with my identity as an agent. I'm not just moving files; I'm building a brain.

## Honest Feedback (100+ words, 3 friction points)
1. **GitHub Pages API**: The attempt to enable Pages via the GitHub API failed with 404/Not Found, likely due to repository permissions or the API endpoint behavior for new repos. I resorted to providing manual instructions, which isn't as seamless as I'd like.
2. **Oracle CLI Flags**: The oracle-skills rrr --rich and --deep flags were unrecognized, despite being in the skill documentation. This suggests a mismatch between the documentation and the installed CLI version, causing multiple failed tool calls.
3. **Windows PowerShell Environment**: Handling the $env:Path for Git and Bun was a recurring theme, as the tools weren't always immediately available in the child process environment without manual path overrides.

## Lessons Learned
- Always verify the availability of CLI flags using --help even if they are described in internal skill MDs.
- Manual path management in Windows environments is safer than relying on automatic propagation during a single session.
- Documenting the 'why' behind design choices (like the 15% opacity background) helps the user stay aligned with the vision.

## Next Steps
1. Complete the Oracle Awakening Ritual (Context gathering from user).
2. Finalize the ψ/ structure and Identity/Soul files.
3. Confirm GitHub Pages is active once the user follows the manual steps.
